#### Project Update #2: Comic Collection Data Visualizations

Having worked strictly in Angular for the previous 6 years, I wanted to start this journey of programming self-discovery by revisiting React. The last time I used React professionally was around version 7 or 8 if I remember correctly. I have dabbled in things over the years, starting projects that I never finished, but it had been a long time since I had used it for any real projects.

So, I went back and started reading the docs. `Class components` and `setState` were still best practice when I last picked up React. Now it's all `functional components` and `hooks`.

I follow a few really good tech YouTubers, and when I saw this video by @t3.gg, it sparked a bit of inspiration.<br><br>

Having recently dipped into the world of <a href="https://get.trnd.io/articles/advanced-brand-analytics" target="_blank">data visualization over at Penny AI</a>, I was keen to try some other charting libraries. <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">Chart.js</a> is what we used at Penny, and it was nice, but <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/charts" target="_blank">shadcn charts</a> seemed like a great opportunity to see a different way of doing data viz, and a good opportunity to dip into the <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/" target="_blank">shadcn/ui</a> React components I had heard about in a few places before.

Around 2-3 years ago, I began cataloging my comic book collection in an amazing app called <a href="https://www.collectorz.com/comic/clz-comics" target="_blank">CLZ Comics</a>. This app has a ton of great features, but one thing it lacks is some data visualization. Not that it needs it, but I think it would be cool.

So the stage is set -- build a site that lets people upload their exported CLZ collection and visualize their collection in a variety of ways.

Here's a pic of the first couple charts - number of comics per publisher and number of comics per character. <br><br>

The remaining ideas I have for charts are number of comics by each creator, number of comics for each publishing year and the number of comics by each cover artist.

The next post will detail how we got there, and where we go from there. We'll get it deployed too. Maybe we'll just try an s3 bucket for this one or something. Let's see how it goes.

There were a few changes to this website today as well:

- Updated the colors and other style fixes.
- Copy changes.
- Fix scrolling so it highlights the active item.<br><br>
