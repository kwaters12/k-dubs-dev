        Ever since the days of Windows 3.1 and DOS, I have been obsessed for how computers work. As
        a kid, software and games seemed almost magic to me. Since then I’ve been working to
        demystify them. Starting my career in game development, I’ve been peeling back the onion of
        software development since, having worked at a

          >YouTube creator network platform</a
        >, <a @click="$emit('scrollToExperience', Experience.StoryDriven)">marketing agency</a>,

        I've been lucky to have done a ton of different things at this point in my career, and I am
        still learning every day. Nothing excites me more than learning something new and applying
        it.

        As a proud father, I try and take time away from the computer, enjoying this beautiful
        country I live in 🇨🇦. Activities include swimming, hiking, biking, picnicking, playing at
        the playground, and even the odd video game session 🧝‍♂️🏹.
