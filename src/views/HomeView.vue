        Ever since the days of Windows 3.1 and DOS, I have been obsessed for how computers work. As
        a kid, software and games seemed almost magic to me. Since then Iâ€™ve been working to
        demystify. Starting my career in game development, Iâ€™ve been peeling back the onion of
        software development since, having worked at a
        <a @click="$emit('scrollToExperience', Experience.Convertus)">
          car dealership website maker</a

        <a @click="$emit('scrollToExperience', Experience.BroadbandTV)"
          >YouTube creator network platform</a
        >, <a @click="$emit('scrollToExperience', Experience.StoryDriven)">marketing agency</a>,

        >,

        I've been lucky to have done a ton of different things at this point in my career, and I am
        still learning. I love making things and solving hard problems.

        As a proud father, I try and take time away from the computer, enjoying this beautiful
        country I live in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. Activities include swimming, hiking, biking, picnicking, playing at
        the playground, and even the odd video game session.
