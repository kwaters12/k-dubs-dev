#### Project Update #3: Comic Collection Data Visualizations 2: Project Setup

The last time I used React for anything work related was around six-seven years ago. So, when I decided that I wanted to brush up on things, I went straight to the docs. That's one thing I learned somewhere around the middle of my career - if ever in doubt, just read the docs.

So that's what I did. I went to <a href="https://react.dev/learn" target="_blank">react.dev/learn</a> and just started at the top. Going through the tic-tac-toe tutorial, I could see what's different - namely hooks, and using functional rather than class components. Also Next.js, which was just starting when I last touched React.

As mentioned in the last post, a great video by @theo.gg introduced me to the new `charts` feature by `shadcn/ui`. The concept of a UI library that encourages maximum customization by providing copy-pastable snippets rather than fully-opinionated components with strict APIs is a fascinating one, and one that I was keen on trying out.

So we had our foundation:

- **Next.js** for our framework -- a good chance to learn what's all the rage.
- **React 18** for our app code -- a chance to learn and play with the newest of new.
- **shadcn/ui** for our UI components, particularly the `charts` piece.<br><br>

Now, I just had to think of what data I wanted to visualize.

As an avid comic book fan since a small child, often times comics are the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to content. As mentioned earlier, I've been using `CLZ` to catalog my collection for the last couple of years. I've always wanted to find different ways to visualize my collection, and this was the perfect chance to do just that.

The first round of charts I want to build are:

- Number of comics by publisher
- Number of comics with each character
- Number of comics by each creator
- Number of comics for each publishing year
- Number of comics by each cover artist.<br><br>

I'm sure that more visualization ideas will come up as this project develops.

#### STEP 1: Get the data

For `CLZ` customers, we can export our collection data from our CLZ cloud site. Ex. `https://cloud.collectorz.com/{MY_ID}/comics` where MY_ID is your individual collection ID.

Select which comics you'd like to export.<br><br>

I've found that the columns with the most reliable data are "Series, Issue, Publisher, Release Date, Format, Characters, Creators, Cover Artist".<br><br>

Now, just export your data and we're good for `STEP 2: Formatting the Data for Digestion`. Coming soon...
